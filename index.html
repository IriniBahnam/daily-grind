		This page demonstrates how to use JavaScript to make the webpage come to life. I implemented coffees for each day of the week and added special styles to accomodate each link or anchor that the user will click on. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I also wanted to make the webpage more responsive for the user to easily access anything they may be looking for. Having a organized and structured webpage can be a more effiecient way for the customer to interact with. Often times when things are hard to navigate the customer will overlook the products.

		JavaScript enables the clients and servers to interact effortlessly. Javascript is also one of the most popular programming languages because it can be easily accessed and integrated with other frameworks.
